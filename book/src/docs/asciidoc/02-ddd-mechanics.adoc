When eating an elephant, take one bite at a time.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, many things can put a project off course.In this chapter, we look at how DDD gives us a set of tenets and techniques to arrive at a collective understanding of the problem at hand in the face of ambiguity, break it down into manageable chunks and translate it into reliably working software.

=== Understanding the problem

==== Problem space versus solution space

==== Dealing with ambiguity

=== Arriving at a shared understanding

=== Modeling a solution

==== Strategic design

==== What is a model?

==== Domain models
[WARNING]
Anemic domain models

==== Context maps

[#_bounded_contexts]
==== Bounded contexts


=== Implementing the solution

==== Tactical design

[#_entities]
==== Entities

==== Value objects

[#_aggregates]
==== Aggregates

==== Services

==== Repositories

==== Factories
