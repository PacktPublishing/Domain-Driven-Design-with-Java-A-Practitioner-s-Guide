== Where and How Does DDD Fit? (15 pages)

[quote,Bob Goff]
We wonâ€™t be distracted by comparison if we are captivated with purpose.

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Over the years, we have accumulated a series of architecture styles to help us deal with system complexity. In this chapter we will examine how DDD compares with several of these architecture styles and how/where it fits in the overall scheme of things when crafting a software solution.

=== Architecture Styles

=== Layered Architecture

=== Onion Architecture

=== Hexagonal Architecture

=== Service Oriented Architecture

=== Microservice Architecture

=== Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

=== Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

=== Serverless Architecture
